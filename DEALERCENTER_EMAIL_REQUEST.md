Subject: Add Email Field to CSV Feed

Hi DealerCenter Team,

We need to add an Email field to the CSV feed. Without it, dealers cannot receive activation links or access their subscriptions.

Required: Email field after DealerName
Example: AccountID,DCID,DealerName,Email,Phone...

Please confirm timeline for implementation.

Thanks,
CarLynx Technical Team
